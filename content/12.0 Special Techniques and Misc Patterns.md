## Special Techniques and Misc Patterns

Power tools and edge-case solvers that don't fit in a single category but frequently appear in real interviews.

### 1.0 Merge Intervals and Sweep Line

1. Merge/insert intervals  
2. Meeting rooms  
3. Line sweep problems (min overlap)  

### 2.0 Binary Search on Answer

1. Minimum feasible value (ship capacity, days)  
2. Monotonic `f(x)` problems  
3. Minimize/maximize result over decision space  

### 3.0 Sliding Window + Monotonic

1. Maximum in window  
2. Min swaps to group elements  
3. Longest subarray under sum/condition  

### 4.0 Reservoir Sampling & Randomized

1. Pick random element with unknown N  
2. Shuffle array uniformly  
3. Randomized hashing  

### 5.0 Simulation and State Machines

1. Game of Life  
2. Spiral matrix  
3. Turing tape / DFA logic  

### 6.0 Design + Iterator Patterns

1. Nested Iterator  
2. Zigzag iterator  
3. Iterator for BST
