# 🧠 DSA Roadmap

Welcome to my personal **Data Structures & Algorithms roadmap**.

This isn’t another generic LeetCode grind plan. It’s my **battle-tested prep log** — structured for clarity, simplicity, and consistency. Built to go from 0 → FAANG with no fluff.

## ⚠️ This entire BS is ChatGPT-assisted

## 🗺 What’s Inside

- 📚 **Structured breakdown** of all core DSA topics
- 🧩 Sub-patterns and mental models per topic
- 🛠 Real-world references and LeetCode tags
- 💭 Minimalist explanations and topic-first navigation

---

## 🚀 Why Quartz?

I used [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to host this as an open, Obsidian-compatible notebook — so you and I can explore it like a digital textbook, without the bloat.

You get instant search, TOC, clean navigation, and Obsidian vault parity.

## 👋 Who is this for?

- 📘 Just starting DSA prep and feeling overwhelmed
- 🔁 Restarting with a structured, deep-dive mindset
- 🧠 Curious how someone else organized the grind
