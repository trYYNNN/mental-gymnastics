## Graphs

Graphs represent relationships and connectivity — foundational for traversal, search, cycles, and dependency resolution problems.

### 1.0 Graph Traversals

1. BFS (level order, shortest path in unweighted)
2. DFS (recursion + stack)
3. Connected components

### 2.0 Directed Graphs and Topological Sort

1. Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS)
2. DFS-based topo sort
3. Cycle detection in directed graphs

### 3.0 Undirected Graphs and Cycle Detection

1. Union-Find / DSU
2. DFS with parent tracking
3. Bipartite check (BFS coloring)

### 4.0 Shortest Path Algorithms

1. Dijkstra (min-heap based)
2. Bellman-Ford (negative weights)
3. A* Search (heuristics)

### 5.0 MST and Spanning Trees

1. Prim’s Algorithm
2. Kruskal’s Algorithm
3. Disjoint Set Union applications

### 6.0 Grid-Based Graphs

1. Word search, island count
2. Flood fill and BFS
3. Multi-source BFS (rotting oranges)

### 7.0 Backtracking and Constraint Solving on Graphs

1. N-Queens
2. Sudoku
3. Hamiltonian Path (TSP, exhaustive)

### 8.0 Advanced Graph Topics

1. Articulation points and bridges
2. Tarjan’s algorithm (SCC)
3. Top K shortest paths (Yen’s algorithm)
